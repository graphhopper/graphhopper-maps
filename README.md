# GraphHopper Maps

This is a responsive UI for the [GraphHopper routing engine](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) rewritten from scratch. Soon it will replace the [jquery-based maps UI](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper#graphhopper-maps).

Try it at [graphhopper.com/maps2](https://graphhopper.com/maps2/).

Get started:

 * use your GraphHopper API key at src/api/Api.ts
   or point it to your local GraphHopper server (change apiAddress in this file)
 * npm install
 * npm run serve
 * open browser at http://0.0.0.0:3000/
